## Overview

This specification defines an extended "Definition of Done" checklist for architecture decisions. Based on Olaf Zimmermann's ECADR criteria, it adds checks for dependencies, references, and master ADR linkage.

---

## Core ECADR Criteria

The foundational Definition of Done consists of five criteria:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    E((E<br/>Evidence))
    C((C<br/>Criteria))
    A((A<br/>Agreement))
    D((D<br/>Documentation))
    R((R<br/>Realization<br/>& Review))

    E -->|"Partnership"| C
    E -->|leadsTo| A
    A -->|reviewedFor| C
    A -->|capturedIn| D
    C -->|referencedIn| D
    C -->|evaluatedDuring| R
    D -->|referenceFor| R
```

### E - Evidence

> **"Are we confident enough that this design will work?"**

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Proof of concept | Has the approach been validated? |
| Prior art | Are there successful examples elsewhere? |
| Expert input | Have relevant experts been consulted? |
| Risk assessment | Have technical risks been identified? |

### C - Criteria

> **"Have we decided between at least two options, and compared them (semi-)systematically?"**

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Multiple options | At least two alternatives considered |
| Comparison criteria | Clear evaluation dimensions defined |
| Systematic evaluation | Options compared against criteria |
| Trade-off analysis | Pros/cons documented for each option |

### A - Agreement

> **"Have we discussed among each other and with peers just enough and come to a common view?"**

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Stakeholder involvement | Relevant parties consulted |
| Consensus or decision | Clear outcome (agreement or escalation) |
| Dissent captured | Any objections documented |
| Authority clear | Decision-maker identified |

### D - Documentation

> **"Have we captured the decision outcome and shared the decision record?"**

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ADR created | Decision documented in standard format |
| Shared/published | ADR available to relevant audience |
| Searchable | ADR indexed and discoverable |
| WH(Y) statement | Core decision captured in structured format |

### R - Realization & Review

> **"Do we know when to realize, review and possibly revise this decision?"**

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Implementation plan | Path to realize the decision exists |
| Review schedule | Review cadence defined |
| Triggers identified | Conditions that would prompt revision |
| Owner assigned | Responsible party for ongoing review |

---

## Extended Criteria (Enhanced Mode)

The enhanced ADR mode adds three additional criteria:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    E((E<br/>Evidence))
    C((C<br/>Criteria))
    A((A<br/>Agreement))
    D((D<br/>Documentation))
    R((R<br/>Realization<br/>& Review))
    Dp((Dp<br/>Dependencies))
    Rf((Rf<br/>References))
    M((M<br/>Master))

    E -->|"Partnership"| C
    E -->|leadsTo| A
    A -->|reviewedFor| C
    A -->|capturedIn| D
    C -->|referencedIn| D
    C -->|evaluatedDuring| R
    D -->|referenceFor| R

    Dp -->|informsImpactOf| R
    Dp -->|capturedIn| D
    Rf -->|detailsIn| D
    Rf -->|maintainedDuring| R
    M -->|tracksIn| D
    M -->|coordinatesWith| R
```

### Dp - Dependencies

> **"Have we identified and documented dependencies on other ADRs?"**

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Prerequisites identified | ADRs this decision depends on |
| Impact awareness | ADRs that depend on this decision |
| Relationship types | DEPENDS_ON, SUPERSEDES, RELATES_TO, REFINES |
| Circular check | No circular dependencies introduced |

### Rf - References

> **"Have we separated detailed specifications into referenced artefacts?"**

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Specs separated | Implementation details in separate files |
| Links valid | References resolve to existing documents |
| Types appropriate | Correct specification types used |
| Versions tracked | Specification versions documented |

### M - Master (if applicable)

> **"If this is part of a larger initiative, have we linked to the Master ADR?"**

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Master identified | Parent MADR linked if applicable |
| Phase assigned | Decision placed in correct phase |
| Registry updated | Master ADR registry includes this decision |
| Scope alignment | Decision within master's scope boundary |

## Implementation Guidance

### Validation Command

```bash
# Validate ADR against Definition of Done
adr validate ADR-045

# Validate with verbose output
adr validate ADR-045 --verbose

# Validate all ADRs
adr validate --all
```

### Example Validation Output

```
Validating ADR-045: Microservices Communication via Kafka
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Core Criteria (ECADR):
  [✓] E - Evidence: PoC referenced in context section
  [✓] C - Criteria: 4 alternatives compared with trade-offs
  [✓] A - Agreement: TDC review documented, approved
  [✓] D - Documentation: WH(Y) statement present, published
  [✓] R - Realization & Review: Review cadence set (6 months)

Extended Criteria:
  [✓] Dp - Dependencies: 2 dependencies documented
  [!] Rf - References: 1 broken link (SPEC-045-B not found)
  [✓] M - Master: Linked to MADR-003 (Microservices Transformation)

Result: PASS with warnings (1 issue)

Warnings:
  - REF-001: Reference SPEC-045-B not found at /specs/SPEC-045-B.md
```

### Automated Checks

| Check ID | Criterion | Automated | Description |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `DOD-E01` | Evidence | Partial | Check for PoC/reference links in context |
| `DOD-C01` | Criteria | Yes | At least 2 options in "neglected" section |
| `DOD-A01` | Agreement | Partial | Governance section populated |
| `DOD-D01` | Documentation | Yes | WH(Y) format validated |
| `DOD-D02` | Documentation | Yes | Published to repository |
| `DOD-R01` | Realization | Yes | Review cadence in governance |
| `DOD-DP01` | Dependencies | Yes | Dependencies section present |
| `DOD-DP02` | Dependencies | Yes | No circular dependencies |
| `DOD-RF01` | References | Yes | All reference links resolve |
| `DOD-RF02` | References | Yes | Spec files exist |
| `DOD-M01` | Master | Yes | PART_OF relationship if phase mentioned |

---

## Pre-Approval Gate

Before an ADR can transition to "Approved" status, tooling should run the Definition of Done checklist:

```bash
adr approve ADR-045
```

Output if checks fail:
```
Cannot approve ADR-045: Definition of Done not satisfied

Missing criteria:
  - A - Agreement: No governance review documented
  - Dp - Dependencies: Dependencies section empty

Run 'adr validate ADR-045 --verbose' for details
```

---

## Scoring Model (Optional)

For organizations wanting quantitative metrics:

| Criterion | Weight | Pass | Partial | Fail |
|-----------|--------|------|---------|------|
| Evidence | 20% | 20 | 10 | 0 |
| Criteria | 20% | 20 | 10 | 0 |
| Agreement | 15% | 15 | 7 | 0 |
| Documentation | 15% | 15 | 7 | 0 |
| Realization & Review | 10% | 10 | 5 | 0 |
| Dependencies | 10% | 10 | 5 | 0 |
| References | 5% | 5 | 2 | 0 |
| Master (if applicable) | 5% | 5 | 2 | 0 |

**Thresholds:**
- **Approved**: Score >= 80%
- **Conditional**: Score 60-79%
- **Needs Work**: Score < 60%
